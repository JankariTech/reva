REVA is an interoperability platform. It connects storage, sync and share platforms and application providers, and it does it in a vendor and platform neutral way by using the [CS3 APIs](https://github.com/cs3org/cs3apis).

This branch is now locked. The work initiated here continues in the following forks:
* For ownCloud, https://github.com/owncloud/reva
* For OpenCloud, https://github.com/opencloud-eu/reva

The [master](https://github.com/cs3org/reva) branch is actively developed and maintained by CERN and the [CS3 Community](https://www.cs3community.org).
